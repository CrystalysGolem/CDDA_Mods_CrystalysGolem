# Xedra Evolved - All Classes

This mod removes the mutual exclusion between Xedra Evolved's four main spellcasting classes:

- **Eater of Dreams** — consume dreamdross for mana and powers
- **Dreamer** — summon entities and create dreamdross
- **Mad Genius (Inventor)** — temporally enhance objects with otherworldly physics
- **Dreamsmith** — forge dreamdross into durable items

Normally, Eater locks out Dreamer, and Mad Genius locks out Dreamsmith. With this mod, you can have all four simultaneously.

## Requirements

- **Xedra Evolved** mod (must be enabled)
- **DDA** (base game)

## Usage

1. Enable **Xedra Evolved** in your world's mod list.
2. Enable **Xedra Evolved - All Classes**.
3. In character creation, you can:
   - Choose any combination of the Awakened hobbies (Eater, Dreamer, Inventor, Dreamsmith) without them cancelling each other.
   - Or pick **"Awakened All"** to start with all four classes at once (12 points).

## Notes

This is a rebalance/power mod. Having all four classes grants access to a wide range of spells and abilities. Use at your discretion.
