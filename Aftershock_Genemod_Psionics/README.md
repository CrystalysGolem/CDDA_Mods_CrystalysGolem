# Aftershock: Genemods + Psionics

Removes the incompatibility between genetic modifications (genemods) and psionic abilities (esper) in the Aftershock: Exoplanet mod.

## What this mod does

- **Mutations**: Espers can receive genemods at gene clinics, and characters with genemods can become espers.
- **Enkindling tinctures**: Removes the 1/200 success penalty for characters with genemods—they now have the same chances (5–15% or 100% with Esper Legacy) as regular characters.

## Dependencies

- Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead
- Aftershock: Exoplanet
