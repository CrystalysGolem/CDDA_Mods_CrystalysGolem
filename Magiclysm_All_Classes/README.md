# Magiclysm - All Classes

This mod removes the mutual exclusion between Magiclysm's spellcasting classes and attunements, allowing you to have them all simultaneously.

## Base Classes (8)

Normally these come in mutually exclusive pairs:

- **Magus** ↔ Animist
- **Kelvinist** ↔ Stormshaper
- **Technomancer** ↔ Earthshaper
- **Biomancer** ↔ Druid

With this mod, you can have all eight.

## Attunements (29)

Attunements are advanced classes gained at attunement altars. Normally you can only have one. With this mod, you can acquire multiple attunements (e.g., Artificer, Alchemist, Blood Mage, etc.) without them cancelling each other.

## Requirements

- **Magiclysm** mod (must be enabled)
- **DDA** (base game)

## Usage

1. Enable **Magiclysm** in your world's mod list.
2. Enable **Magiclysm - All Classes**.
3. **Character creation:** Pick **"Master of All Arts"** hobby (16 points) to start with all 8 base classes, or choose any combination of magic professions without exclusions.
4. **In-game:** Visit attunement altars to gain attunements. With this mod, new attunements will not remove your existing ones.

## Notes

This is a powerful rebalance mod. Having multiple classes and attunements grants access to a very wide range of spells and abilities. Use at your discretion.
